Requirements for run_test.pl
----------------------------

 File::Basename
 Time::HiRes
 File::Temp
 File::Copy
 File::Path
 Cwd
 Getopt::Long

Most distributions of Perl will have everything


How to add a regression test
----------------------------

1. Write a ${test}.sql file with test sql queries

2. Generate and tweak ${test}_expected file:
   regress/run_test.pl --expect ${test} && vi ${test}_expected

3. Add ${test} to $(dirname ${test})/tests.mk*

Optional:
   If your test has unusual setup or teardown requirements, you may create
   any of the following optional files (they will run in this order):
        ${test}-pre.sh
        ${test}-pre.sql   (run via psql)
                 (The test itself is run here.)
        ${test}-post.sql  (run via psql)
        ${test}-post.sh

Notes about running individual regression tests
-----------------------------------------------

The script run_test.pl can be called directly to run individual
regression tests. Run it without parameters for info about its usage.

Note that tests run in a staged install which is created by running
make staged-install. This step is a part of the complete make check.
